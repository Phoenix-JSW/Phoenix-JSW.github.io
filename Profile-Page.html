             <h2> My Story</h2>
             <p>  I have always had a passion for IT, which lead me down the road to becoming a Microsoft and Novell Systems Engineer and Mail Administrator after I left the British Royal Navy.  I worked in 3rd line intel server teams for British Telecom, Computer Science Corporation, JPMorgan, Chase Manhattan Bank and HSBC before Migrating to Australia where I took on a Team Leader & Project Management Role at Promina Insurance in Sydney.
             </p> 
             <p> After taking time out to have a family I took a role with Bunnings, completed my AIM Business Management Diploma and moved into Retail Management.  I have managed a few different departments within several different stores, managing up to 40 team members at any one time.  After becoming a single mum, I took a small step back to spend some quality time with my kids.  I took on the role of Safety, Care & Recoveries Officer, Store Facilities & preventitive maintenance administration, with a little training thrown in for good measure. I have always taken pride in ensuring any issues are dealt with in a Smooth and Efficient manner.  Having strong interpersonal skills, I have always been able to work autonomously. 
             </p>
             <p>This is my first attempt at my portfolio website, 6 weeks into the She Codes Plus course and our second project. This site is deployed using static HTML/CSS to my GitHub pages, but hopefully as my skills and knowledge improve, I will be popping back to give this site regular updates. 
             <p> Please feel free to drop me a line with any feedback, always open to constructive criticism.
             </p>
             <p>Iâ€™m looking forward to where this journey may lead, and I hope you enjoy seeing this site evolve as much as I am looking forward to at creating and experimenting with it as my knowledge grows.</p>
             <p>Please come back again! </p>
